(SHORT PRESENTATION)

Hello! I'm Miguel Pay√°, from Spain. First of all I would like to say you thanks you so much for this awesome course! This is what I've been searching for long time and I will do my best on it.
I would like to say you that my level of English is mid level,so sorry if the text that I wrote have not so much sense.

(EXPLANATION)

I decided to use the image of Harvard in the left of the navbar like if this is the logotype of the page. Next of it I added a nav with links to another pages.

After it, I decided to add the Jumbotron from Bootstrap and use this default colors because I like it. I wanted to add a link to my Linkedin profile as well.

Next of the Jumbotron, I added few columns from Bootstrao and I used a bit of CSS to make it look better. Here I used the @media queries to make 4 columns instead of 2 rows of 2 colums.

And after using SASS I needed to add a SCSS inheritance so I decided to create it at the bottom of the webpage.
